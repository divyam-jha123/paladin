 * <p>{@link org.lfdt.paladin.sdk.core.abi.AbiEntry} models a
 * function/constructor/event/error/fallback, {@link org.lfdt.paladin.sdk.core.abi.AbiParameter}
 * models its inputs/outputs and tuple components, and {@link

 * are the associated enums. All types are immutable and round-trip through any Jackson {@code
